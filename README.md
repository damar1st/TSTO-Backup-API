# TSTO-Backup-API
Request presaved TSTO Tokens, Avatars and Landfiles from TSTOLE.DE - for TSTO-Server Developers ONLY

To request a LandFile, you first need to obtain the original token using the email address:

https://tstole.de/newtool/api.php?gettoken=user@email.com

If the token file is available, you will receive a JSON response like this:

{
  "email": "user@email.com",
  "token": "106362698005010525657223466420999999",
  "Longlifetoken": "QVQxOjIuMDozLjA6NzIwOllOVlViS09MYVVZaGZsdE1CNUIzODYzNGh2aDdkOG9qbGpFOjI3MzQ3OnJpZW50"
}

With the email and token, you can now request the LandFile:

https://tstole.de/newtool/api.php?landfile=user@email.com&token=106362698005010525657223466420999999

If the file exists, you will receive a ZIP file in response, which contains the following files:
The LandFile in various modes, the CurrencyFile, and the FriendListFile.
Sample files can be found in the "Samples" folder.

As a third option, you can also request the avatar:

https://tstole.de/newtool/api.php?getAvatar=user@email.com

The avatar will be returned as a PNG response.

Over 2,000 backups have been created by users. However, due to an initial server issue, itâ€™s possible that not all LandFiles are available on the server.

An upload API for LandFiles is also coming soon...

Happy Tapping!
